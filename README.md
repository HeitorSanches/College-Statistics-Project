# College-Statistics-Project
This was a project I completed for a college statistics assignment where my task was to analyze data about distance learning vs. in-person learning. I decided to use data from the 2023 Higher Education Census by INEP and apply this analysis.

## Environment : Jupyter Notebook & Google Sheets
## Python Libraries : Pandas, Plotly Express
